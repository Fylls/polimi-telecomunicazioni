N  := window size
Rn := request number
Sn := sequence number
Sb := sequence base
Sm := sequence max


function receiver is
    Rn := 0
    Do the following forever:
        if the packet received = Rn and the packet is error free then
            Accept the packet and send it to a higher layer
            Rn := Rn + 1
        else
            Refuse packet
        Send a Request for Rn


function sender is
    Sb := 0
    Sm := N + 1
    Repeat the following steps forever:
        if you receive a request number where Rn > Sb then
            Sm := (Sm − Sb) + Rn
            Sb := Rn
        if no packet is in transmission then
            Transmit a packet where Sb ≤ Sn ≤ Sm.  
            Packets are transmitted in order.
